// make these header or hero page of my doctor booking app and you can  a refine these full code or rewrite new code as "Design a sleek, modern, and visually stunning UI for a web application using responsive layouts. The UI should be user-friendly, advanced, and award-winning in look. Use soft shadows, gradients, neumorphism or glassmorphism effects (as suitable), and smooth animations (Framer Motion-style or CSS transitions). Include clearly defined sections, beautiful cards, buttons with hover effects, stylish modals, and clean typography.

// Color palette should be soft yet vibrant (e.g., pastel blue, soft blues, gentle oranges, or minimal dark theme). Add visual highlights and call-to-actions (CTAs) using subtle animations. Keep the layout responsive and mobile-friendly with smooth transitions and smart use of whitespace.

// Overall vibe: Professional, clean, next-gen startup-level interface. Use modern CSS (Tailwind), or custom styled-components with Framer Motion for interactive transitions.

// Do not change any backend logic. Focus only on the frontend. The UI must be plug-and-play with existing backend APIs and logic.

// Add necessary UI enhancements, transitions, highlights, hover effects, and layout improvements for maximum visual impact."
